# Seminar Attendance Tallying Program made in Java

Pardon my use of boilerplate code in generating the worksheets for each college course, I was simply too lazy to make a fuunction out of it.


This is a quick (actually not so quick, it took me some time to relearn how to code in Java) Java program I made to automate the creation of the attendance report for our 2025 CICS Summit seminars.

We were originallly planning on tallying up the attendance manually, but I felt lazy and instead procrastinated by making this code that automates the process.

I might add comments later on to better explain what each block of code does. But for now, feel free to read through my messy code. Enjoy!
